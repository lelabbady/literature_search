    "\n",
    "**Interpreting the results:** Each point in the plot is a referenced paper, plotted by year (x-axis) and number of citations (y-axis). The size and color of the point denote how many papers in the selected group share the reference.\n",

    "**Future directions:** Right now, this tool is only for small-scale datasets; we manually labeled the papers. In the future, this tool could be scaled my assigning keywords computationally i.e. by taking the most used words (with a filter for common words like \"the\").\n",
